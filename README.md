## 🚧 Beta Notice

> **Heads up:** Slamhaus is currently in **beta**. While it’s fully functional for building and deploying sites, expect rapid iteration and breaking changes as features like WebAssembly evolve.

---

## 📘 Introduction

Slamhaus is a modern static site generator built in C++17. It converts `.md`, `.smd`, and `.slam` files into clean, fast, fully static HTML. Designed for developers who care about control and clarity, Slamhaus extends Markdown with a readable, hackable syntax for layout, buttons, forms, scripting, and more — all with zero JavaScript required.

Built like a game engine, Slamhaus features a modular C++ architecture, real-time WebAssembly scripting via Emscripten, and first-class support for SEO and internal link rewriting.

Whether you’re building documentation, a microproduct, or a portfolio with WASM-powered interactivity, Slamhaus gives you a toolchain that’s fast, terminal-friendly, and completely yours.

What makes Slamhaus different to other static website generators?

* **Game-dev-style architecture** with a clean C++ codebase
* **Zero JavaScript required** thanks to WebAssembly and Emscripten integration
* **Instant feedback** with custom tags for UI elements, scripting, and forms
* **No runtime dependencies** — just Markdown in, HTML out

Whether you’re building a portfolio, documentation site, or launching a small product, Slamhaus helps you do it with speed and style — all without leaving the comfort of your terminal.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Get up and running with Slamhaus in minutes — no installs, no setup scripts, just binaries and Markdown.

### 🛠 1. Download a Precompiled Binary

Pick your platform:

* [Windows](https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus/releases/download/nightly/slamhaus-windows.zip)
* [Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)](https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus/releases/download/nightly/slamhaus-linux-debian.zip)
* [Linux (Arch)](https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus/releases/download/nightly/slamhaus-linux-arch.zip)

Unzip the archive and make the binary executable if needed:

```bash
chmod +x slamhaus-linux-*
```

---

### ▶️ 2. Build the Site

From the folder containing `slamhaus`, run:

```bash
./slamhaus-linux-*
```

> On Windows, just double-click `slamhaus.exe` or run it from `cmd.exe` or PowerShell.

Your static site will be compiled to a `build/` folder.

---

### 🌐 3. Open It in a Browser Or Upload to Your FTP!

```bash
cd build
```

Open `index.html` in any modern browser — you're live!

---

<details>
<summary><strong>🧱 Build from Source</strong></summary>

Want to compile Slamhaus yourself? It’s simple and dependency-light — just a compiler and `make`.

---

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* A **C++17-compatible compiler** (`g++`, `clang++`, or MSVC)
* **`make`** installed

**On Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

**On Arch:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel
```

**On Windows (via MSYS2):**

```bash
pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make
```

---

### 📥 Clone & Build

Download the repo or run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus
cd Slamhaus
make
```

This will build the `slamhaus` executable in the root of the project.

---

### 🔧 What the Makefile Does

Slamhaus includes a cross-platform `Makefile` that:

* Recursively finds and compiles all `.cpp` files in `src/`
* Automatically includes all `src/` subdirectories
* Creates a `build/` directory for object files
* Statically links dependencies on **Windows** so users don’t need DLLs

The result is a clean `slamhaus` (or `slamhaus.exe`) executable in your project root.

> **Windows Note**: The `Makefile` uses `-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++` flags to reduce dependency issues on Windows builds. You can run `slamhaus.exe` directly in PowerShell or CMD.

---

### 🚧 Generate Your Site

1. Download a template:

   * [Slamhaus Basic Template](https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus-Basic-Template)

2. Place it in the root folder and rename it to `content/`:

```
Slamhaus/
├── slamhaus
└── content/
    ├── index.md
    ├── about.md
    └── include/
        └── nav.md
```

3. Run Slamhaus and choose how you want to build:

```bash
./slamhaus
```

> On Windows: run `slamhaus.exe` in PowerShell or CMD.

* Press `1` to generate your site from the default `./content/` directory.
* Press `2` to specify a different folder (absolute or relative).

---

### 📂 Output

Your site will be generated in the `output/` folder — ready to upload anywhere.

---

### 🔧 Local Preview

You can preview the generated site using a simple local server:

> **Requirements**: Bash & Python 3 must be installed (macOS, Linux, WSL, or Git Bash on Windows).

```bash
./scripts/serve.sh    # Start the server at http://localhost:8000
./scripts/stop.sh     # Stop the server
```

<details>
<summary><strong>📂 Project Layout</strong></summary>

The structure below shows how a typical Slamhaus project is organized:

```text
.
├── content/                     ← Your source files (.slam pages, partials, assets)
│   ├── assets/                 
│   │   ├── media/              ← Images, videos, audio files, and other media
│   │   └── theme/              ← CSS stylesheets (merged and inlined into the final HTML)
│   ├── include/                
│   │   ├── config.ini          ← Site-wide metadata and default SEO settings
│   │   ├── header.smd          ← Partial: content rendered into the <header> tag
│   │   ├── footer.smd          ← Partial: content rendered into the <footer> tag
│   │   └── nav.smd             ← Partial: defines the site’s navigation structure
│   └── index.slam              ← The homepage of your site (written in Slamhaus Markdown)
│
└── output/                     ← The fully generated static site (HTML, CSS, JS)
```

---

### 🔍 Notes

* Use `.slam` files for full **pages** — each will be converted to an `.html` file.
* Use `.smd` files for **partials** — reusable fragments like headers, footers, and navigation.
* Partials in `include/` (e.g. `header.smd`, `footer.smd`, `nav.smd`) are **automatically rendered** into the final page template.
* The `output/` folder is regenerated on every build. It is safe to delete between builds.
* You can link between pages using `.slam` extensions in your Markdown or Slamhaus tags; these are automatically rewritten to `.html`.

### 🧠 WebAssembly Scripting with `@script[]()`

```markdown
@script[
  src:"/scripts/greet.js"
  bind:"#greet-btn"
  call:"Greet"
  args:"name-input"
  types:"string"
  result:"greeting-output"
]()

@script[
  src:"/scripts/add.js"
  bind:"#add-btn"
  call:"Add"
  args:"num1,num2"
  types:"int,int"
  rtype:"number"
  result:"sum-result"
]()
```

| Attribute | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src`     | Path to the generated JavaScript glue file                       |
| `bind`    | Element ID to attach event listener to (`#btn-id`)               |
| `call`    | C++ function name to call                                        |
| `args`    | Comma-separated list of input element IDs to extract values from |
| `types`   | C++ argument types (`int`, `float`, `string`, etc.)              |
| `rtype`   | Optional. Expected return type (`number`, `string`, etc.)        |
| `result`  | ID of the element to inject the return value into                |

---

### ⚙️ Example C++ Code for WASM Integration

```cpp
#include <emscripten.h>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>

extern "C"
{
    EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
    int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
    const char* Greet(const char* name)
    {
        static std::string msg;
        msg = "Hello, " + std::string(name) + "!";
        return msg.c_str();
    }
}
```

> 💡 **No manual compilation required** — Slamhaus automatically compiles your `.cpp` source files into WebAssembly at build time and generates the JavaScript glue code for use with `@script[]()`.

Just place your `.cpp` file inside the `scripts/` folder, and reference it by name:

```markdown
@script[
  src:"/scripts/greet.cpp"
  bind:"#greet-btn"
  call:"Greet"
  args:"name-input"
  types:"string"
  result:"greeting-output"
]()
```

Slamhaus will:

* Compile `greet.cpp` into `greet.js` + `greet.wasm`
* Expose `Greet` for use in the browser
* Inject and wire up the glue code automatically

## 📁 Templates

Need a starting point? Check out the official Slamhaus starter kit:

### 🧱 [Slamhaus Basic Template](https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus-Basic-Template)

A minimal, no-fluff template to help you hit the ground running. Includes:

* `index.md` homepage
* Preconfigured `config.ini`, `nav.md`, and theme files
* Asset folders for media, CSS, and icons
* Example usage of extended syntax

To use it, run this command **inside your Slamhaus directory**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus-Basic-Template content
```

Then just run:

```bash
./slamhaus
```

Your site will be built into the `output/` folder—ready to deploy.

📌 **Note:** By default, Slamhaus looks for a folder named `content/`. You can specify a different path when running it, or modify the default in `main.cpp` to suit your workflow.

---

## 🧭 Planned Features

**Emscripten Wrapper & DOM Operations.**
High-level C++ interface for DOM manipulation, event binding, and element queries—write frontend logic in C++ using Unreal-style syntax, compiled to WebAssembly.

## ⚙️ About the C++ Codebase

Slamhaus is written in modern **C++17**, designed to be lightweight, modular, and familiar to developers from game development or systems programming backgrounds.

> Slamhaus isn’t just written in C++ — it’s structured like an engine:
>
> * Input is data (`.md`, `.smd`, `.slam`)
> * Output is artifacts (`.html`, `.wasm`)
> * Systems are isolated, composable, and explicit — no global state
>
> The architecture is friendly to engineers who think in terms of compilers, render passes, or asset pipelines — not front-end frameworks.

### 🔍 Code Philosophy

* **Readable, not clever** — The code favors clarity over compression. It's meant to be hackable and approachable, especially for students and indie devs.
* **Game-engine inspired** — Namespaces and folder structure reflect common engine conventions: `core`, `cli`, `parser`, `util`, `wasm`, etc.
* **Minimal dependencies** — Slamhaus uses only the C++ standard library. No Boost. No heavy runtime frameworks. Portability is a priority.
* **Modular, not monolithic** — Each component (parser, renderer, WASM, CLI, etc.) is designed to be isolated, reusable, and replaceable.

### 🗂 Folder Structure

```
src/
├── cli/        ← CLI utilities and menus
├── core/       ← Site generation, config, templates, assets
├── parser/     ← Markdown parsing and Slamhaus tag logic
├── util/       ← Small helper modules (e.g., string utils)
├── wasm/       ← Optional C++→WASM compilation logic
```

### 🧪 Standards & Practices

* **C++17 only** — Use language features available in `-std=c++17` for compatibility.
* **Header + Impl Separation** — Each `.hpp` file contains minimal declarations and lightweight comments; implementations live in `.cpp` under the same path.
* **No global state** — Config and page state are passed explicitly via structs like `SEOData` or `ParseState`.

### 💡 Code Style

* Use **`namespace` blocks** instead of classes where appropriate (e.g. `Parser::ParseMarkdown()`).
* Keep comments **concise** but useful—especially in public headers.
* Stick to **camelCase for variables** and **PascalCase for structs/functions**.

> If you're familiar with engines like Unreal or Godot, Slamhaus should feel immediately intuitive.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is Slamhaus, exactly?</summary>

Slamhaus is a fast, Markdown-powered static site generator built in C++. It lets you create clean, lightweight websites using readable, extensible syntax — no JavaScript or templating engines required.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to know C++ to use it?</summary>

Nope! You can use Slamhaus with just Markdown. The C++ integration (via WebAssembly) is optional — great for interactivity, but not required for simple sites.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What file extensions does Slamhaus support?</summary>

`.md`, `.smd`, and `.slam` are all parsed as Markdown with extended syntax. Slamhaus treats `.smd` as partials, `.md`/`.slam` as full pages, and automatically rewrites their links to `.html` in output.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I preview my site locally?</summary>

Run `slamhaus` to generate the site, then preview it using:

```bash
./scripts/serve.sh
```

Or use any local HTTP server to serve the `output/` folder.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where is my site output stored?</summary>

After building, everything is placed in the `output/` folder — ready to deploy on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your own server.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use my own theme or CSS framework?</summary>

Absolutely. Slamhaus includes a minimal CSS theme by default, but you can customize or replace it entirely. Just add or override files in `content/assets/theme/`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it support SEO, favicons, or custom domains?</summary>

Yes! Use `$site[]()` and `$page[]()` metadata tags to define things like page titles, meta descriptions, favicons, and more.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is Slamhaus production-ready?</summary>

For most static site use cases, yes. It’s stable and fast, but still evolving — so contributions and feedback are welcome.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it support blogging or dynamic content?</summary>

Right now it’s best for static pages. Micro Backend support are on the roadmap, enabling dynamic features soon.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use WebAssembly without writing JavaScript?</summary>

Yes. Slamhaus lets you write C++ functions and bind them directly to your HTML using `@script[]()` — no JavaScript needed. 

Here’s an example:

**`greet.cpp`** – A native C++ function that returns a greeting message:

```cpp
#include <emscripten.h>
#include <string>

// 'extern "C"' prevents C++ name mangling so the function name is preserved
// exactly as "Greet" when exported to JavaScript.
extern "C"
{
    // EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE tells the Emscripten compiler *not* to strip away
    // this function during optimization. This ensures the function is available
    // to JavaScript via Module.ccall or Module.cwrap.
    EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
    const char* Greet(const char* name) 
    {
        // Use a static string to keep the memory alive after the function returns.
        // This avoids returning a pointer to a temporary or stack-allocated object.
        static std::string msg;

        // Compose the greeting message using the input name.
        msg = "Hello, " + std::string(name) + "!";

        // Return a pointer to the internal C-string of 'msg'.
        // This will be read in JavaScript as the return value.
        return msg.c_str();
    }
}
```

---

**Your Markdown (.md) file** – Interactive input + button that runs `Greet()` without writing JS:

```markdown
?input[
    type:"text"
    placeholder:"Your name"
](#name-input)

?button[
    type:"button"
    text:"Say Hello"
](#greet-btn)

<p id="greeting-output"></p>

@script[
    src:"/scripts/greet.js"

<summary>Why C++? Isn’t that overkill for static sites?</summary>

Maybe — but it’s fast, portable, and familiar to devs from game/engine/tooling backgrounds. Slamhaus treats your site like a build artifact: predictable and performant.

<details>
<summary>How is this different from Jekyll, Hugo, or Eleventy?</summary>

Slamhaus is built entirely in C++, uses no Node or Ruby, and supports extended Markdown syntax with layout and scripting features out of the box. It’s lean, hackable, and doesn't depend on external runtimes.

<details>
<summary>Can I build my entire site from scratch with just Markdown?</summary>

Yes. You can define layout, navigation, buttons, forms, metadata, and even scripts using Slamhaus Markdown. No HTML necessary.

</details>

<summary>Where do I report bugs or request features?</summary>

Open an [issue](https://github.com/bitboyb/Slamhaus/issues), or submit a pull request if you’re feeling brave.
