## 💡 What Makes Slamhaus Different?

:column[size:3](#slamhaus-difference-columns)

### 🧠  
### Built Like a Game Engine

Slamhaus is architected with the same clarity and modularity you’d expect from a modern game engine. Every subsystem — parsing, rendering, templating, SEO — is designed for isolation and reusability. It avoids global state, favors explicit logic, and is cleanly written in C++17, making it easy to navigate and extend, even for large or unconventional projects.

### 🧬  
### No JavaScript? No Problem.

With [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) support, Slamhaus lets you write frontend behavior in C++ and compile it directly to WebAssembly. Want a button that runs a function or a form that returns live feedback? Use `@script[]()` — Slamhaus auto-generates the glue code.

### ✍️  
### Markdown That Does More

Slamhaus extends the Markdown language itself — not with templates, but with expressive, human-readable tags. Define layouts with `:section[]()` and `:column[]()`. Add functional forms with `?input[]()` and `?button[]()`. Control metadata with `$page[]()` and build interactivity with `@script[]()`. It’s Markdown that writes HTML for you — smart, composable, and readable.

### 📝 Markdown In → Website Out

At the heart of Slamhaus is a simple promise: write Markdown, and get a complete HTML site — no templating language, no runtime. Just `.slam`, `.smd`, or `.md` files and a clean build output. You focus on your content and structure; Slamhaus handles the rest.

### ⚙️ Engineered in Modern C++

Unlike most static site tools that rely on scripting runtimes, Slamhaus is a compiled C++17 engine. This gives you speed, transparency, and control — especially for teams coming from game dev, systems programming, or embedded domains. The codebase is modular, familiar, and built for clarity.

:section[](#feature-syntax)

### 🧩 Extended Markdown Syntax

Slamhaus turns Markdown into a layout and logic language with a clean set of custom tags:

- `:section[]()` for grouping and alignment
- `:column[]()` for responsive multi-column layouts
- `?form[]()` and `?input[]()` for building interactive forms
- `!image[]()`, `!video[]()`, `!svg[]()` for rich media
- `$page[]()` and `$site[]()` for page and global metadata

All fully parseable, all without leaving your Markdown editor.

### 🧠 WebAssembly-First Design

Slamhaus integrates seamlessly with WebAssembly via Emscripten. Write small C++ functions to handle events, then bind them to buttons, forms, or inputs with `@script[]()` tags. Slamhaus compiles and wires everything for you — no JS glue code, no runtime hacks, just clean C++ compiled to fast, portable WASM.

:section[](#feature-themes)

### 🎨 Lightweight, Tweakable Themes

Forget bloat. Slamhaus includes a minimal CSS theme to get you started, then stays out of your way. All styles live in `content/assets/theme/`, and are merged + inlined at build time. Customize colors, spacing, breakpoints, or swap it out entirely — it's your call.

```
content/assets/theme/*.css
```

:section[](#feature-links)

### 🔗 Smart Internal Link Rewriting

Write links the way you think — using `.slam`, `.smd`, or `.md`. Slamhaus will automatically convert all internal references to `.html`, even inside buttons, metadata, and nav structures. No broken links. No tedious find/replace.
